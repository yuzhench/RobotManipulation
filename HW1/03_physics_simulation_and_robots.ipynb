The **IIWA14** is a 7-DOF industrial robot arm from KUKA. Drake includes many robot models that you can load directly from Drake, which is what we will do in this part. You can find a full list of the available Drake models [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/models).\n\n**YOUR TASK:** Load and visualize the IIWA14 robot using Drake's physics engine.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- `Parser`: Loads robots or assets described with robot description files (like URDF/SDF/MJCF) files into the physics engine\n- `MultibodyPlant`: Drake's main physics simulation engine for robots and objects. This will be the backbone for all of our simulations.\n- `SceneGraph`: Drake's module for handling everything related to registering robot and object geometries, handling geometry queries, collision detection, etc.\n- **Base Welding**: Fixing the robot base to the world frame is important so it doesn't fall!\n\n**Reference:** For this part, we will closely follow the [Drake Simulation example](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Drake-0b3b2c53-a7ad-441b-80f8-bf8350752305/project/Tutorials-2b4fc509-aef2-417d-a40d-6071dfed9199/notebook/simulation-1ba6290623e34dbbb9d822a2180187c1) from [Chapter 2](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/robot.html) from the class textbook - in this part we will follow the **\"Simulating the (passive) iiwa\"** and **\"Visualizing the scene\"** sections closely.

The video should show your initials falling onto the table, which is welded in place close to the robot (but not penetrating it).\n\n**Hint**: `WeldFrames` takes a third argument a `RigidTransform` (which you will learn about later in the class). For now, you can just pass in a `(x,y,z)`-position with `RigidTransform([x,y,z])` to weld frames with an offset. (As always, if you are unsure about a function signature take a look at the [official documentation](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.multibody.plant.html))\n","block_group":"48f067b86e5e4035bf31f19878ae83ce"},{"cellId":"7bf2d6cb3dd545ceb84dab1623f07a7b","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"983bf51e","execution_start":1755548155689,"execution_millis":0,"execution_context_id":"3b130765-f3fd-4fae-b2ed-4af4a6a29919","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":true,"cell_id":"7bf2d6cb3dd545ceb84dab1623f07a7b","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Before you start, make sure to run the following cell to clear the meshcat window!\nmeshcat.Delete()\nmeshcat.DeleteAddedControls()","block_group":"c4f462bb95e64da9be2b1515ec7bc7e8","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null,"content_dependencies":null},{"cellId":"9e9f2d2c004d4728b195b0692d51bb24","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"48f36a50","execution_start":1755548192479,"execution_millis":0,"execution_context_id":"3b130765-f3fd-4fae-b2ed-4af4a6a29919","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":true,"cell_id":"9e9f2d2c004d4728b195b0692d51bb24","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# TODO: Your implementation here!\n\n\ndef simulate_full_system(\n    initial_iiwa_positions: np.ndarray,\n    initial_letter_poses: list[RigidTransform],\n    table_pose: RigidTransform,\n    simulation_time: float = 15.0,\n) -> None:\n    # TODO: Create a diagram builder and add a multibody plant and a scene graph to it\n\n    # TODO: Load the IIWA14 robot and weld the base to the world frame\n\n    # TODO: Load the table and weld the base to the world frame.\n    #       Don't forget to set the pose of the table by passing `table_pose` to the `WeldFrames`\n    #       method as the third argument!\n\n    # TODO: Load the letters in your initials\n    # HINT: Remember to use 'assets/...' to access the letters, as we did above!\n\n    # TODO: Add a visualizer to the builder\n\n    # TODO: Finalize the plant and build the diagram\n\n    # TODO: Create a diagram context and a plant context\n\n    # TODO: Set the positions of the IIWA14 robot joints.\n    # HINT: Since we now have multiple free objects in the scene, we need specify\n    #       that we are setting the positions of the IIWA14 robot joints:\n    # plant.SetPositions(plant_context, iiwa, initial_iiwa_positions)\n\n    # TODO: Load the letters and set their initial poses.\n    # HINT: To set the poses of the letters, we need some new functionality.\n    #       This is because the letters are free-floating bodies, and we need to set their poses,\n    #       which includes both positions and orientations.\n    #\n    #       First, we need to get the RigidBody associated with the letter, and then set its pose\n    #       using the SetFreeBodyPose method, which accepts a RigidTransform as an argument.\n    #\n    #       Here is an example of how to do this, for the letter B:\n    #       (Important: notice that we first load the letter, then finalize the plant, and then set the pose)\n    #\n    #               ```\n    #               B_letter = parser.AddModels(f\"assets/B_model/B.sdf\")[0]\n    #               ...\n    #               plant.Finalize()\n    #               ...\n    #               body = plant.GetRigidBodyByName(\"B_body_link\", B_letter)\n    #               plant.SetFreeBodyPose(plant_context, body, initial_letter_poses[0])\n    #               ```\n    #\n    #       (Note the name \"B_body_link\", which is hardcoded in the SDF for each letter generated by our\n    #       letter generation function.)\n\n    #       Now use the same pattern to set the poses for your letters!\n\n    # TODO: Fix the actuator inputs to zero for the plant\n\n    # TODO: Create a simulator and run the simulation for the given `simulation_time`\n    pass","block_group":"a7766259d06a4733816787ee24adf387","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null,"content_dependencies":null},{"cellId":"e0a0be8dc15f4a93baed9f392e347f6b","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"e0a0be8dc15f4a93baed9f392e347f6b","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"Run the code below to visualize your simulation!\n\n**Tip:** If you ever want to download a recording of your simulation as a `.html` file, append `/download` to the meshcat URL in your browser.

These skills will be essential for the more advanced topics later in the class, as well as for your class project!\n\n**Next:** In Notebook 3, you will learn how to quickly assemble complex scenes using a `scenario.yaml` file and `HardwareStation`.","block_group":"55f9849a1696444a884845cb4db8ca42"}],
